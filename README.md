in this repository is my site for Rosseti olympiad (it is specially in here, because i wanted to host is in github pages). 

What it does? it is game-changer for final task in that olympiad (actually i became first), which point was to make a project of cheapest electrical system for a year-long use. My site helps to do it with next tools: drawing the el. system on premade grid with use-point (which can be anything: factory, city...), placing switching equipment, counting cost of that all, exporting it in excel, json, importing from json.

you can try it on https://astrxgore.github.io/Astrxgore
